I-Got-U

Our game developed during a game jam with my team
I Got U
"Sometimes the greatest obstacle is being alone. But I’m here with you—I’ll catch you."

🎮 About the Game
I Got U is a puzzle-platformer that focuses on cooperation and trust between two characters. Together, they overcome challenging platforms by helping one another: one opens the door, the other passes through; one reaches higher ground and helps the other up. What’s impossible alone becomes achievable only through teamwork.

This game was developed by our team in just 48 hours during the Bambu Game Jam.
